So. Patreon payments are suspended for this one.

Now you know!\n\nChicken salad includes:\nHalf mayo, half yogurt (for sandwiches, lean toward mayo. For eating straight, lean toward yogurt.)\nCelery, green onion, apple (grapes work great too)\nfreshly toasted slivered almonds (this is like the tastiest secret to great chicken salad)\nseasoned to taste with salt, pepper, mustard, turmeric, cayenne, whatever else you want because it is your salad and you deserve delicious snacks",

Find out with this classic mobius strip love test.\n\nI learned this from Mike Caputo in around 2010, and as far as I know he originated this trick, or was an early popularizer of it, in his 1990 article in the Jan/Feb edition of The Oregon Mathematics Teacher (and if anyone can find this article maybe it will give more insight). I blogged about it in Feb 2011 after teaching it in a workshop when I was Mathemusician in Residence at Harvard's Pforzheimer House (anyone here from those days? Hello!), but unfortunately all the links in that post are now dead (as is the blog itself) and my memory is fuzzy. So if you have info to share please send me a note!\n\nBut just to keep as much of the history and attribution as I can, here's the dead links I have for Mike: http://teach.beaverton.k12.or.us/~mike_caputo/ and for the article: https://www.octm.org/TOMT.html \n\nI've seen a number of great videos on this in the past ten years, but none that capture quite the spirit and framing of the original love test in the way I remember it. Or maybe this is never how it originally was and I made it all up. No idea, but I had fun making this and I hope you had fun watching it :D\n\nAnd an extra special Valentine's Day thanks to my Patreon patrons, whose support make this possible. Thank you Ray Sidney, Pat Devlin, David Perryman, Andew Romaner, Andrea Bi Biagio, Jodi Vezzetti, Yana Chernobilsky, David Smith, Alan Boulton, Nancy Blachman, and Caleb Wright, for your extra support!\n\nYou can support this work here: https://www.patreon.com/vihart",

These came from the brilliant mind of an artist on Etsy named Tess, though she no longer seems to have a shop or a public-facing web presence. Tess, if you see this please please tell me WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND WHEN YOU DECIDED BEATLES TRUNCATED OCTAHEDRA WERE A THING THAT NEEDED TO EXIST. Because you were right. So right.

This video is VR180, so if you have a cardboard or other headset you can see the shapes in stereo, or look around in magic window on a phone or drag the video with the cursor.\n\nScutoids are officially named for the first time in this paper: \"Scutoids are a geometrical solution to three-dimensional packing of epithelia\" https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05376-1\n\nSpecial thanks to Clara Grima for answering my scutoid questions, and to Laura Taalman and Tom Ruen who contributed to the creation of paper scutoid nets based off of 3D scutoid models by Laura Taalman, who invented the packable pair of identical scutoids (see https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3024272 ) , and John Peplinski, who created the space-filling cairo tile scutoid design (see https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3042446 ).
