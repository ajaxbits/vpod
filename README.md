# What is this?

This is a way to learn Rust lol

But also, I want a good way to get youtube subscriptions in my podcast player **as audio**

# A plan

* Hook into youtube-dlp
* Stream output to some kind of server that will provide a url
* make an rss feed of those urls
* point podcast app to this rss feed
